# Flujo_energeticoAPI-REST

## Abstract
The EICMA Villa Clara,Cuba Company has a high flow of information regarding the
company's vehicles and the use of fuel they make, which is processed to calculate a
series of metrics that said entity needs to make decisions at all levels that relate to
these areas as each level has its responsibilities and interests. With the objective of
modernizing and synthesizing the workflow of said entity, it is desired to build a
computer system that offers storage, access, and data calculation facilities.  As a
result of the work carried out, a system has been implemented that will allow the
entity to both collect and efficiently use the necessary information.

## Implementation 
Python is the main programming language in the backend and Django REST framework
was used to create the REST API because it has very good tools for the implementation of a REST API.
